# Dynamic algorithms

Outline of this chapter

We will present two algorithms:
* **value iteration**
* **policy iteration** (sometimes called **strategy iteration** or **strategy improvement**)

<!-- In the end we will argue that these algorithms both fall into a larger family of algorithms, called generalised policy iteration.
